# Chain the Gain! Liberate Language Learning With Blockchain

Language learning is online. But to get a certificate, you need institutions. Let's liberate language certificates with blockchain! Study with our app and get microcertificates – minted as NFT!

## Inspiration

Language learning has become more digital and is inherently decentralized – people use all kinds of apps for it. But to get an official certificate, we still need to go to an institution, pay a lump sum, and then hope that we pass. Shouldn't this work better? Can blockchain liberate language certificates?

## What it does

Chain the Gain offers a simple interface to study your favorite language. When you make progress and your knowledge rises, we automatically detect your skill level and assign you a microcertificate. E.g., instead of doing one large test for "English C1", you get a microcertificate for "English Daily Conversation". This microcertificate is minted as an NFT and associated to your account on the blockchain, so it is irreversebly connected to you and cannot be modified later!

## How we built it

Hedera Hashgraph, React, Bootstrap

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We actually connect to the testnet and mint a real NFT!! It's hosted on IPFS!! Really!!
